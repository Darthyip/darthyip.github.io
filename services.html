                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">Reiki is a Japanese healing art that places hands on different places of the body to help it heal. If you are hurt or sick, the body holds all of that in itself and once you release it you can heal better and faster. The way I describe how it works is this: Your body is made of over 3 trillion cells! All of these cells are moving around, bumping into each other. This causes friction, which releases heat, which creates light. This light is at a frequency that most of use can't see, but our furry friends can. The reason why they find the places that hurt the most and seek them out by sitting on them is because they can see and feel the difference between healing and sick. But thi energy is there and we can use it to heal. The energy can either pull in one area or be absent. It closes the holes and moves stagnant energy to healthy flowing energy.<br><br>It was in the late 1800s Dr Mikao Usui found Reiki. He was the president of a small Christian university in Kyoto, Japan. He studied Christianity and Buddhism trying to find a way to heal both the mind and the body at the same time. The results are now what we practice as Reiki.<br><br>I also offer Swedish massage and Shiatsu. For Swedish massage I specialize in relaxation and rejuvenation. Shiatsu is a Chinese massage. In this kind of body work the recipient, like in Reiki, keeps their clothes on and uses different areas on the body that correspond to different organs in the body that form channels throughout the body. These channels are the same as used in acupuncture. I use pressure points on the body to give you healing cleansing. You will feel relaxed and energized at the same time.<br><br>Our Furry friends really respond well to Reiki especially cats and horses. Energy work, Reiki and Shiatsu, are the best for them. Dogs really love Shiatsu massage. Dogs like massage with range of motion stretching and some energy work mixed in.</p>
